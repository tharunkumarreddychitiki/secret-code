# secret-code

I have just created a program as a fun task to encode and decode a message using 'random module' and ' string module' and a small if-else conditional statement. 

In this program, if 1(for Encoding)is chosen then the first letter of the word is removed and added in the last and also some random alphabets are added to each and every word on both the sides in the message if the word has more then three letters in it. If not it will simply reverse the word.
In this manner a new encoded message is generated that can be hard to read.

If 2(for decoding) is chosen the program will reverse the above process and give the decoded message that is easy to read.

This program is fun to play with frnds and send them secret message that none else can read.

#have a great day!
